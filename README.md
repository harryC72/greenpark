This is a small fullstack app built in Vue and Node/Express.js. The frontend Javascript code is written in Typescript.  The express-app serves an 
array of products which are displayed in the Vue-application. The user can interact with the products and change color, status (active/inactive) and linked states. 

You run the application by writing "npm run dev" in the console on the applications root level. 
There are tests for the backend which you run by writing "npm run test" in the console on the root level.
